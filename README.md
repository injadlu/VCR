# VCR: Rethinking Visual Content Refinement in Low-Shot CLIP Adaptation
Implementation of our paper: [Rethinking Visual Content Refinement in Low-Shot CLIP Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14117)

## Introduction
In this paper, we systematically analyze current CLIP adaptation methods and discover a perceived bias issue in these adaptations. 


## Running
the running can be categories into following steps:
1. run  feat-extraction.py 
2. run  feat-selection.py
3. run  feat-merge.py
4. run  main_imagenet.py for ImageNet, and main.py for other 10 datasets
